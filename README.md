## Unit 5

Unit 5 is about re-establishing your practice while also progressing your research methodologies. By creating new artworks that address your developing interests in materials and contextual themes, you will prepare for a group crit of your work. 
The Unit will be taught through a series of workshops and tasks that will involve collective ways of working. The studio will be a key part of this work as you develop your understanding of contribution and dependency, as well as articulating your ‘position’ through the creation of a Manifesto. 
As part of your Research File, you will be required to reflect on your progress through self-evaluation and an outline of your proposed context. The reflective process will enable you to reconsider your artistic motivations: how do these reflect your identity, your sense of narrative and the relation of your work to wider questions of social, racial and/or environmental justice principles*
  
Unit 5 Research file will comprise of: 
·    A manifesto – to demonstrate an awareness of the contexts you explore in your practice (100-200 words).  

·    Annotated documentation concerning your own developing practice, and relevant research of other artists and contexts. You must include the notes you make about your ideas and the development of your artwork, including: notes on the subject, process, content, materials or concept – to let us know how you conduct your research. In total, written annotation should add up to 800-1000 words.
